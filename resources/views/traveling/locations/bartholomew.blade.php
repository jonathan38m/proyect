        You will discover this relatively small but amazing island. What this Island lacks in wildlife it makes up for scenery. At the top of a steep wooden stairway, there is a magnificent 360-degree view which boasts a perfect angle from which you can take unforgettable photos of Carved Rock, Pinackle Rock, and the ocean in the background. Your experience will not be complete if you don't snorkel in the waters of this impressive paradise.
