    <h3>Muro de LÃ¡grimas (Wall of Tears)</h3>
    <p class="text-justify">
        Is a wall that was built by prisoners with not much more than their bare hands in the 1940s. Fortunately this prison is no longer occupied, and it forms part of the landscape and the history of Isabela. You can climb up to the top of the structure, where you can meditate on the incredible contrast between the beautiful scenery of Galapagos, and the traces of those who once lived there.
