    <h3>Otavalo Indigenous Town</h3>
    <p class="text-justify">
        Definitely one of the most beautiful indigenous markets in South America, it is famous for its art and craft market and weekly fiesta that celebrates the good commerce. Here you will have the opportunity to meet the local people, buy handmade textiles and crafts and try typical food.  Close you can find San Pablo Lake and Cascada de Peguche a ceremonial center for ritual purification during the festival of the sun, which is called “Inti Raymi” where members of the indigenous community bathe there for purification and to connect with Mother Nature.
